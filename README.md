# 🎯 Real-Time Face Recognition System

A comprehensive face recognition application built with OpenCV and Python that detects and identifies faces in real-time using computer vision and machine learning. This system allows users to capture face data, train custom recognition models, and perform live identification through webcam feed with high accuracy.

## 📋 About The Project

This face recognition system implements computer vision algorithms to:
- Detect faces in real-time video streams using Haar Cascade classifiers
- Train custom face recognition models using LBPH (Local Binary Patterns Histogram) algorithm
- Identify individuals with confidence scoring
- Manage multiple user profiles with organized dataset structure

Perfect for learning computer vision fundamentals, building attendance systems, access control applications, or security monitoring solutions.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Webcam/Camera
- pip (Python package manager)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AbdenetI/Face-Recognition-System.git
   cd Face-Recognition-System
   ```

2. **Navigate to backend and create virtual environment**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python -m venv .venv
   
   # On Windows:
   .venv\Scripts\activate
   
   # On macOS/Linux:
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

**Step 1: Capture Face Data**
```bash
python scripts/capture_faces.py --user YOUR_NAME --max 100
```
This will capture 100 images of your face for training.

**Step 2: Train the Model**
```bash
python scripts/train.py
```
Trains the recognition model on your captured data.

**Step 3: Run Face Recognition**
```bash
python scripts/recognize.py
```
Starts real-time face recognition. Press 'q' to quit.
